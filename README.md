RPN Evaluator README

Author: Eduardo Ramirez


This my solution to the Indiegogo coding assignment. I created a stack to obfusciate the additional functionality of an Array. In additon, I created my own atoi and atof. The program evaluates an RPN expression and prints the solution to stdout. It is ran from rpn.rb. The code is documented to explain any ambiguities in my solution. If there any questions regarding my solution, please feel free to contact me.
